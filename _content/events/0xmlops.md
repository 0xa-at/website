  Do you want to go beyond training your machine learning model in
  a notebook? - Now is your chance at 0xMLOps! 🥳

  Join us on June 18th at 5pm at Stufenforum (OIC), where we will start with the “AI Landscape on campus”, a short introduction round 🗣️, highlighting companies and student intitiatives like FiveSquare, neuron.ai, and Young AI Leaders. They will talk about who they are, what they do, and how you can get involved!


  Afterwards, we will have a structured live-coding session 💻 where you are invited to follow-along. We will walk you through a fun use-case where you’ll get to train a simple model, save, package and deploy it, such that it can be used for inference in a final product 🎯


  Are you ready to begin your MLOps journey? ✨ Make sure to mark your calendars and signup, we look forward to seeing all of you!
