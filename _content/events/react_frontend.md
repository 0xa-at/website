🚀 From Backend to Full Deployment: A Hands-on React Workshop! 🌐

In this workshop, we build on a backend developed in a previous session and take it to the next level! You'll learn to:

✅ Develop and test a frontend using React
✅ Dockerize the provided backend for seamless deployment
✅ Deploy everything on a server with free SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt

By the end, you'll have a fully functional, secure web app—ready to go live! 🔥

📅 Join us to level up your skills while enjoying free snacks and drinks 🍻
