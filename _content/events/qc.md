description: We're excited to announce our upcoming event "Quantum Computing - From Theory to Practice" on March 28th, in cooperation with LIT - Open Innovation Center. This event will feature three talks focused on Quantum Computing and take place at the Stufenforum/OIC. 


    The first talk will be a brief introduction to the topic by Alexander Peherstorfer, which will provide a foundation for the audience to understand the more complex concepts that will be discussed later in the evening. The second talk, given by Richard Küng, will delve deeper into specific concepts related to Quantum Computing and provide a more detailed understanding of the topic. Finally, the third talk will be given by a speaker from IBM, Elisa Bäumer, who will discuss practical applications of Quantum Computing. More specific information on the given talks will follow soon.


    Overall, these talks aim to provide a comprehensive overview of Quantum Computing and its potential applications. Attendees will come away with a greater understanding of this exciting and rapidly evolving field, as well as insights into how Quantum Computing may impact their lives in the near future. Don't miss this opportunity to expand your knowledge and network with like-minded individuals. The event will take place at the Stufenforum/OIC. We look forward to seeing you there!
