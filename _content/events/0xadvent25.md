  0xA Science Advent Calendar

  Throughout 1–24 December, we open a new door to science each day on social media. Our Science Advent Calendar brings you easily digestible facts and surprising insights from Computer Science, Mathematics, and Artificial Intelligence — this year in the form of both text posts and short video explainers created together with researchers from JKU.

  Whether you're a student, a science enthusiast, or simply curious, the calendar offers a fun way to learn something new every day leading up to Christmas. Follow along and discover how fascinating science can be — one tiny dose at a time.
