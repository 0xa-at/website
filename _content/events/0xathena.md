    Are you tired of the same old learning experiences at university or work? Are you ready to take your knowledge to the next level and learn some truly extraordinary and unique skills? If so, then come join us at the Grand Garage on January 13, 2023 at 14:00 for a workshop day like no other!

    During this workshop day, you'll have the opportunity to learn about a wide range of topics, from hardware programming to game hacking. You'll be taught by university students and people working in the industry who are passionate about these topics and who will provide you with hands-on experience and in-depth knowledge. Plus, as a bonus, you'll be able to take home the hardware that you use during the workshop for just 15$ – a small price to pay for the valuable skills you'll gain.

    But that's not all – after the workshop, there will be a networking session where you can connect with other like-minded individuals and continue to learn and grow together. Plus, there will be free food and drinks provided, so you can enjoy a tasty snack while networking and sharing ideas with others. Don't miss out on this amazing opportunity to learn some truly unique and valuable skills – sign up now!
